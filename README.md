# Hotel Booking Demand: Canceled or Not

This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations, a critical challenge in the hospitality industry. Accurate predictions of cancellations allow hotels to optimize revenue, manage resources efficiently, and improve customer satisfaction by anticipating occupancy needs. By analyzing booking data, the project identifies key patterns that influence cancellation behavior, such as lead time, booking method, and special requests.<br><br>

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), various trends were uncovered using visualizations, helping to understand the most important factors that impact booking outcomes. To enhance the dataset, feature engineering techniques were employed to extract significant insights, improving the quality of predictions. The issue of imbalanced data was addressed by using sampling strategies to balance the model training process.<br><br>

This project showcases the practical application of data analysis in the hospitality sector, it also provides actionable insights that can help hotels reduce cancellation rates and improve revenue management.<br><br>
